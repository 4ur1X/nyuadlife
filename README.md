## LIFE @ NYUAD

### Project Description

This is a launch website for my animated short film showing the day in the life of a student studying in one of the most prestigious liberal arts universities in the world – NYU Abu Dhabi. I have kept the theme of the website minimalistic and cartoonistic to match that of the video. I have mainly used three colors in the website – <strong>violet, yellow and gray</strong> – which are considered the official color palletes of NYU. The website contains 4 separate webpages – <strong>Home/Trailer, About, Cast, Shop</strong>.
