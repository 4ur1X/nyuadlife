## LIFE @ NYUAD

### Project Description:

This is a launch website for my animated short film showing the day in the life of a student studying in one of the most prestigious liberal arts universities in the world – NYU Abu Dhabi. I have kept the theme of the website minimalistic and cartoonistic to match that of the video. I have mainly used three colors in the website – <strong>violet, yellow and gray</strong> – which are considered the official color palletes of NYU. The website contains 4 separate webpages – <strong>Home/Trailer, About, Cast, Shop</strong> – that can be visited by clicking on the navigation links. The main page contains a countdown timer to indicate the remaining time before launch. The website is interactive because each webpage has a "Click here" button that when clicked, alternates the background colors of the site. Moreover, when the cursor hovers over the navigation links, they enlarge and change color to violet.

### Process:

The process was very smooth and organized.
- I first started by designing a basic layout or <strong>wireframe</strong> of the website and its separate pages using Canva. At this stage, I also decided the colors to be used along with the fonts and content.
- Then, I went on to designing the film posters (in About page) in Canva. I went with the animated or cartoonistic appearance because my video was an animation.
- After a few days, I began coding the basic text layout with HTML for each webpage using my previously done wireframe as reference.
- As I gradually learnt CSS, I began adding colors and styles to the webpage elements.
- I first completed the main trailer (home) page completely so as to make it easier to build other pages based on it.
- It was a bit hard for me to decide as to what interactivity to add to the website using JavaScript. So, I just added a button that when clicked changes the background color of the site, and when the user hovers over the links, it highlights and enlarges them. I also implemented a countdown timer using JavaScript (by referring to W3Schools).
- Once all the pages were completed, I went through the code again to remove any unnecessary parts and make it more legible while also adding comments.

### Reflection:

I am satisfied that my website looks exactly similar to my wireframe. It's minimalistic and simple to navigate. Though, I changed a few designs at a few places to make it look better. I would have liked to add more interactivity to my website, but considering this was my first time making a full website using JavaScript, I'd consider it a good start for me.
