## LIFE @ NYUAD

### Project Description

This is a launch website for my animated short film showing the day in the life of a student studying in one of the most prestigious liberal arts universities in the world – NYU Abu Dhabi. I have kept the theme of the website minimalistic and cartoonistic to match that of the video. I have mainly used three colors in the website – violet, yellow and grey – which are the official color palletes of NYU.
